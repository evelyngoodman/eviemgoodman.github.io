                Hi! My name is Evelyn Goodman. I've just recently graduated cum laude from the University of Washington with a degree in Informatics â€” Data Science.

            <p id='about-text'>
                I have always considered myself to be a storyteller, and while that originated in my passion for writing and literature, I've since been able to translate that storytelling ability into the study of information systems. 
            </p>
            <p id='about-text'>
                I am very interested in the impact of data and software on people's lives and their understanding of information through the many systems we engage with on a day to day basis.
